# My Project Template 

## Meta (delete this section)

During my work I have come across various projects. To better structure my work and to be better prepared for my upcoming projects, I have developed a project structure which helps me during both pre-sales and delivery phase. I means that the consultants are able to anything that was developed during pre-sales and vice versa. 

The storage backend for the projects is git, as it allows for multiple remote storage locations, sub-modules if we need to pull in another repository from another source, etc. By replicating to Google Drive, we can share the repository with other users and use the Google Drive access control mechanisms.

This project template should be used as a customer template, which will then in turn hold a reference to all projects delivered to the customer. That practice allows us to have all projects in one spot, easy grep-ing, etc.

## Structure

The project template is structured in the following way:

- *Assets* - This is where we store all Assets. Things delivered from the customer, or images we created and so forth. This directory may contain project related sub-directories, but that can be decided on a project by project basis.
- *Meeting Minutes* - This is where you store all text-based meeting minutes. The meeting minutes should be saved in a form that would allow chronological sorting (i.e. yyyy-mm-dd-on-site.txt). This directory may contain project related sub-directories, but that can be decided on a project by project basis.
- *Proposals and Presentations* - I think this name speaks for itself
- *Engagement Reports* - This is the consultants space. 
- *Project Plans* - This is where we store project plans, etc. 

## Information outside of this repository

Modify the README.adoc to contain links to all sources related to this customer / project. Wherever you store assets outside of this repository you should link the content within this README, so the repository is really the single source of truth:

- Links to PT
- Links to Mojo
- Links to Salesforce

# Working with the project template

## Repository naming conventions

We should agree on a common way of naming repositories...TBD

## Instantiating a repository

The setup of the project template is 2-folded. First we initialize the repository and fetch the template. Then we add another remote to push our repository to (Google Drive in my case). Our new project is called `new-project`. Let us create a directory and initialize the git repository.

```
$ mkdir new-project
$ cd new-project/
$ git init
$ touch .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Please note that we add the .gitignore, because the merge will not work on a completely empty repo.

Now let us add the remote skeleton location and merge it into our current master.

```
$ git remote add -f skel https://github.com/juhoffma/project-template.git
$ git merge --squash -s recursive -X ours remotes/skel/master
$ git commit -am "applying project template"
```

Great now the project template is applied and we can go ahead and define the new remote. In my case I am using a google drive to host my git repositories. The Google Drive is automagically synced to a local folder which means I am putting my local location as a new remote.

```
$ GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER="/Users/buddy/RH Google Drive"
mkdir "${GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER}/new-project.git"
cd "${GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER}/new-project.git"
git init --shared --bare
cd -
git remote add origin "${GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER}/new-project.git"
git push origin master

## Sharing the repository with other users

TBD

## Creating a local clone of a repository

TBD

## Merging your changes with the master repository

TBD

## Handing over master repository ownership to another person

TBD

That's it, now you are good to go
