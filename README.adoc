# My Project Template

During my work at Red Hat I have come across various projects. To better structure my work and to be better prepared for my upcoming projects, I have developed a project structure which helps me during both pre-sales and delivery phase. I means that the consultants are able to anything that was developed during pre-sales and vice versa. 

The storage backend for the projects is git, as it allows for multiple remote storage locations, sub-modules if we need to pull in another repository from another source, etc.

This project template should be used as a customer template, which will then in turn hold a reference to all projects delivered to the customer. That practice allows us to have all projects in one spot, easy grep-ing, etc.

The project template is structured in the following way:

- *Assets* - This is where we store all Assets. Things delivered from the customer, or images we created and so forth. This directory may contain project related sub-directories, but that can be decided on a project by project basis.
- *Meeting Minutes* - This is where you store all text-based meeting minutes. The meeting minutes should be saved in a form that would allow chronological sorting (i.e. yyyy-mm-dd-on-site.txt). This directory may contain project related sub-directories, but that can be decided on a project by project basis.
- *Proposals and Presentations* - I think this name speaks for itself
- *Engagement Reports* - This is the consultants space. 
- *Project Plans* - This is where we store project plans, etc. 

# This README
This Readme should be modified as well. It should contain links to all sources related to this customer / project. It should contain links to PT, to salesforce, to mojo, etc. Wherever you store assets outside of this repository you should link the content within this README, so the repository is really the single source of truth.
